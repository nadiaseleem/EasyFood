# ðŸŒŸ Libraries and technologies used

- Navigation component: to manage navigation within the app and creating a single activity that contains multiple fragments, rather than creating multiple activities. 

- Retrofit: to make HTTP connection with the rest API and convert meal json file to Kotlin/Java
  object.
  
- Room: to save data (favourite meals) in a local database on the user's device. This can be useful for caching data or for offline functionality.

- MVVM:  this pattern helps in saperating the app's UI logic from its business logic. This makes the app easier to maintain and update. 

- LiveData:  a library for reactive programming in Android that helps to create observable data that can be updated and observed in real-time.
  it is useful for managing the state of the app's UI, since it allows changes to the data to be propagated to any observers automatically.
 LiveData is designed to be lifecycle-aware, which means it automatically cleans up any observers when the component they're attached to (such as an activity or fragment) is destroyed. 
  
- RxKotlin: to handle asynchronous background threading, such as network requests or database operations, without blocking the main thread or causing performance issues.

- Dagger Hilt: for dependency injection to simplify the app's architecture and make it easier to manage dependencies between different components.

- view binding : to automates the process of inflating views in the app's UI instead of manually inflating views in code.

- Glide : for loading and caching images in the app's UI.
